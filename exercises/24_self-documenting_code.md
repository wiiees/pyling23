**24.1.** ‚≠ê So far you have been documenting your code with hashtag-comments (ignored by the Python interpreter) and with triple-quotation-marked strings. What do you believe is the purpose of each? What are differences?

**24.2.** Will the following two lists end up being equivalent? Why (not)?

```python
some_list1 = [
    'abc',
#    'def',
    'ghi',
    'jkl'
    ]

some_list2 = [
    'abc',
'''
    'def',
'''
    'ghi',
    'jkl'
    ]
```


**24.3.** When you were still unfamiliar with the Python syntax, you may have frequently added plain English translations as comments, as in the example below. Check whether you can find this type of comments in your own code from earlier sections.

```python
my_dict = {}   # create an empty dictionary
my_number = 5432   # assign integer to variable
```


**24.4.** Worse than comments that are redundant, are comments that _lie_. Identify the ways in which the following comments are unclear and/or misleading (try to answer this first without running the code). 

```python
n = input('Enter a number:')     # get an integer from the user
print(f'You entered {n}!')

my_list = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi']
my_list2 = [s[::-1] for s in my_list]   # invert the list

my_dict = {'a': 15, 'b': 20, 'c': 25}
# print each character
for x in my_dict.items():
    print(x)
```


**24.5.** Even comments that are initially true can become lies: they are easily overlooked when modifying the code, so perhaps comments are best avoided as much as possible altogether. Fortunately, comments can be actively _made_ redundant (and then removed) by choosing more transparent variable names. Can you change the variable name in the following snippet, so the comment can be deleted?

```python
d = {}  # will map place names to their inhabitant counts
```


**24.6.** ‚≠ê By renaming variables, make the following code more self-documenting, and remove any comments thereby made redundant (you can make other code improvements too):

```python
mapping = {'John': '098124', 'Sue': '657317', 'Bob': '135809'}  # mapping from student names to their IDs
mapping2 = {a: b for b, a in mapping.items()}	# construct the inverse mapping

x = '657317'    # this is the student ID that I need to know the name for

if x in mapping2:
    print(mapping2[x])	# print the student's name
```


**24.7.** For the same reason that variable names (when well-chosen) can be self-documenting, _auxiliary_ variables can increase code clarity. Improve the following code by assigning the computed value to a (meaningfully named) variable first, instead of printing it directly. Make other improvements too (including, but not limited to, using `math.pi`).

```python
c = [7, 4, 5, 8, 6, 9, 5]   # these are circle radii
for r in c:
    print(3.1415 * r**2)
```


**24.8.** Just like auxiliary _variables_, auxiliary _functions_ too can make code more self-documenting. Define a function for computing the thing that gets printed in the previous example. Having made this change, do you feel you still need the auxiliary variable introduced in the previous exercise, or can you call the function directly inside the print statement?

**24.9.** The foregoing examples show that _brevity_ is not the point, _readability_ is: The original code was shorter than either the auxiliary variable variant (1 extra line), or the auxiliary function variant (extra lines to define the function). Likewise, self-documenting variable names tend to be longer than uninformative `x` or `y`. Can you think of reasons why brevity as such is not the point?

- - - - - -
**Something to keep in mind:** Adequately named variables and functions make your code (more) **self-documenting** (why is that a good thing again?). As a rule of thumb, the greater the distance between variable assignment and variable use (or function definition and function call), the longer (i.e., more informative) its name should be.
- - - - -

**24.10.** Can you give a possible motivation for the above rule of thumb? Looking back at some of the exercise solutions for previous sections, did we generally follow this rule? In which circumstances might uninformative variable names such as `x` be acceptable?

**24.11.** Also bad for code safety are so called **magic numbers**, i.e., seemingly arbitary numbers that occur in the middle of the code. In some cases, magic numbers can be derived from existing objects instead of manually entered. Use this to improve the following code (and explain why it is an improvement):

```python
project_topics = ['sentiment analysis', 'zipf\'s law', 'collocations', 'distributional semantics']
students = ['Alf', 'Beth', 'Gemma', 'Dale', 'Ebba', 'Zod', 'Ethan', 'Philip']
team_size = 8 / 4
print(f'{team_size} students will work together on each project')
```


**24.12.** Sometimes a magic number cannot be 'derived' as in the preceding exercise, but instead it represents some type of configuration setting, to be chosen prior to running the script. This is illustrated below. First of all, can you make this more self-documenting?

```python
with open('some_existing_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()

text = text[:500]   # consider only first 500 characters just to test!
```


**24.13.** It is often a good idea to separate the _core program_ from the customizable _settings_ with which to run it (like the number above). Try to give several reasons, from different angles, on why such separation might be a good idea (consider also its relation to general programming principles such as DRY, SLAP and SoC from Section 7). Can you think of ways to achieve this?

**24.14.** Implement one of the ways you came up with for the above example. Improve the usability of the example further, so that choosing the value like `False` or `0` or `None` (instead of a number like `500`) will result in the entire text being used.

**24.15.** A number is considered 'magical' if, roughly, it hides the intent of the programmer in choosing that number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)). Can you relate this to the concept of self-documenting code? Do you feel your earlier function for computing the area of a circle contains magic numbers?

**24.16.** Variables with meaningful names inevitably carry the implication that they will be subsequently used. If this is not the case, i.e., for variables that will not be reused, the underscore `_` is conventionally used, as in the example below. Go through your code to see if any variables could be replaced by `_` to make the code more readable:

```python
for _ in range(10):
    print("Hurrah!")
```

**24.17.** A bit of an aside, but try executing something simple in the Python Console that evaluates to some value, like `8 * -2`, and then, on the next prompt, enter `_ + 5` and execute it. What special behavior does this show the underscore variable has in the Console? Does `_` work the same way in a Python script?


**24.18.** Just like adequate variable and function names, the _data structures_ used can (and should, where possible) communicate their purpose. Which Python data structures do you know by now? What are their purposes?

**24.19.** ‚≠ê Make the following code more self-documenting (and more safe) by (manually or with code) representing the data in a more suitable data structure before executing the query. Additional improvements are possible too. 

```python
# Names of students and the corresponding (!) student IDs.
# Warning, if you change one list make sure you change the other!
names = ['John', 'Sue', 'Bob', 'Chris']
ids = ['124987', '098513', '098122', '198732']

# find the student ID of Bob:
id = names.index("Bob")
x = ids[id]

print(x)
```


**24.20.** ‚≠ê Do the same for the following code (explain what is less than ideal, then improve it):

```python
# student records consist of the fields name, age, id and major:
students = [
    ['John', 22, '1249871', 'linguistics'],
    ['Mary', 24, '4198712', 'psychology'],
    ['Bob', 32, '089123', 'mathematics'],
]

for x in students:
    if x[0] == 'Bob':
        print(x[2])
```



**24.21.** Make the following code more self-documenting (and again, more safe):

```python
unique_numbers = [1,6,3,2,5,7,9]

if 8 not in unique_numbers:    # check to ensure numbers remain unique
    unique_numbers.append(8)
```


**24.22.** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Make the following code as clear and self-documenting as possible, taking into account all of the above considerations, about Python style, comments, variable names, auxiliary variables and functions, magic numbers, and appropriate datastructures (and the remarks about avoiding indexing, in section 19). You may have to change quite a bit!

```python
python = ['John', 'Sue', 'Bob', 'Chris', 'Peter', 'Pjotr', 'Maria']  # all students of the python for linguists class
pts = [80, 60, 43, 75, 27, 92, 94]  # points they earned for the exam
total = 100
g = [10 * i/95 for i in pts]   # only 95 because 5 points were bonus
p = [i > 5.5 for i in g]
# now print the results, followed by the number of failing students
for i in range(len(python)):
    print(python[i], g[i])
nf = 0
for b in p:
    if b:
        nf += 1
print(nf)
print([s for i, s in enumerate(python) if not p[i]])	# these failed the exam
```


**24.23.** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Your future self kindly asks you to review your own code for some of the Coding Quests, and try to make it more self-documenting.
