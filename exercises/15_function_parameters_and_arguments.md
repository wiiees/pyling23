**15.1.** ⭐ Without looking up a definition, try to explain in your own words what a _function_ is in programming (specifically Python). The current section aims to increase your understanding of this central concept.

**15.2.** You have already seen two ways of passing arguments into a function: by simply passing in a value or variable, or by using an equals sign such as `sep='-'` in `print('apple', sep='-')`. Without looking it up, try to formulate a hypothesis about the difference between the two ways of specifying arguments, and when you should and shouldn't use `=`. (The truth is difficult to guess from the exercises so far, but by formulating a specific hypothesis now, you will be better able to grasp the actual explanation later in this section.)

**15.3.** Define again the simple function `print_spam` we used in earlier sections, which takes no arguments and simply prints `spam`. Explain (for instance using `type`) what the difference is between `print_spam` and `print_spam()`.

**15.4.** What happens if you assign a function to a variable, e.g., `shout_nonsense = print_spam`? Can you call the function using the new variable, instead of the original name? And what if you do `shout_nonsense = print_spam()` instead?

**15.5.** ⭐ Write a function `do_twice` that takes a function `func` as a parameter and calls that function twice. Having done that, calling `do_twice(print_spam)` should execute `print_spam()` twice. What happens if, instead, you accidentally do `do_twice(print_spam())`? Why? <!-- tp2 -->

**Something to keep in mind:** In Python, a function is _not_ a piece of code, and calling a function is _not_ a matter of sending the interpreter to the lines in your file where the function is defined. Rather, in Python **functions are objects in their own right**. A `def`-clause is an instruction to the Python interpreter to create such an object and assign it to a variable with the same name as the function. In Python tutorials you'll often read that 'functions in Python are first-class citizens', to mean exactly this. Accordingly, functions, just like the other objects we have worked with so far (strings, ints, lists), can be (re)assigned to variables and passed around as arguments.
- - - - -

**15.6.** ⭐ Define a function `do_twice_with_argument` that takes two arguments, a function `func` and a value `arg`, and calls the function twice with that argument. The command `do_twice_with_argument(print, 'test')` should result in `test` being printed twice. <!-- tp2 -->

**15.7.** Can you predict the outcome of `do_twice_with_argument(do_twice, print_spam)`? Test your prediction and make sure you understand what is going on. (In between these exercises, it is advisable to print an empty line to keep track of which output comes from which exercise.)

**15.8.** ⭐ Generalize the previous functions to `do_multiple` and `do_multiple_with_argument`, by adding a parameter `n` to each, with the effect that the function `func` will be executed `n` times (`range` can be useful here).

**15.9.** As objects, functions carry some information along with them, such as the `__doc__` attribute containing the function's docstring (shown when `help` is called on the function, as we did earlier), and `__name__` storing the function's name. Try `print(print_spam.__name__)`. (Can you explain what happens if you do `print(print_spam().__name__)` instead?)

**15.10.** What happens to the `__name__` attribute of a function if you assign a function to a new variable, and retrieve the `__name__` property from that new variable?

**15.11.** Function objects also offer various methods (similar to strings having methods like `upper` and `capitalize`, and lists having `append` and `index`). Calling a function like `print('apple')` is in fact shorthand for invoking the `__call__` method of the function object, i.e., `print.__call__('apple')`. Verify that this is the case, and also test it for a couple of functions you yourself defined.

**15.12.** Recall that ctrl+click (or cmd+click) on a variable brings you to the place where a value was assigned to it. Try this in the example below, on the variable `var` in the definition body. Where, according to this method, is this variable assigned a value?

```python
def example_function(var):
    print('blablabla')
    print('1234567')    # just some filler material
    print(var)
```


- - - - - -
**Something to keep in mind:** It may seem like we use 'argument' and 'parameter' interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference. When you _define_ a function, you specify its **parameters** in the header of the `def`-clause. When you _call_ a function, you can provide it with **arguments**. The called function will _use_ the provided arguments _as values for_ its parameters. But how does Python know which arguments are meant to set which parameters? The following exercises teach you more about that.
- - - - -

<br>**_Positional arguments and keyword arguments_**

**15.13.** ⭐ When calling a function, you have seen that sometimes arguments are simply given as a value, and sometimes as a `parameter=value` expression, a so-called **keyword argument** (e.g., `print('apple', end='')` uses both). In Python, you can often choose how to pass values as arguments to a function: the value on its own, or as a keyword argument `parameter=value`. Look carefully at the following code, predict the outcomes and test your predictions.

```python
def print_diff(a, b):
    print(a - b)

print_diff(5, 2)
print_diff(a=5, b=2)
print_diff(b=2, a=5)
print_diff(2, 5)
print_diff(a=2, b=5)
print_diff(b=5, a=2)
```


**15.14.** Arguments passed _without_ the parameter name are also called **positional arguments**. Given the previous example, do you understand why?

**15.15.** Given your answer to the preceding question, try to predict which of the following works fine, and which one crashes. Test your prediction and make sure you understand what is going on.

```python
print_diff(5, b=2)
print_diff(2, a=5)
```


**15.16.** Although positional and keyword arguments can be mixed, no positional argument can _follow_ a keyword argument. Try `print_diff(a=5, 2)` to see what error you get. Here is an intuitive explanation: argument order (for positional arguments) is determined by counting left-to-right (right?), so if a keyword argument indicates 'order doesn't matter here', then the order of any arguments to the right of it cannot be relied upon either, hence any arguments to the right of it must also be given as keyword arguments. (Pause to see if you understand.)

**15.17.** Although typically one can choose whether to call a function with positional or keyword arguments or both, sometimes programmers may decide that certain (or even all) arguments _must_ be passed as keyword arguments. This is the case, for instance, for functions that permit any number of positional arguments, such as the built-in function `print`, e.g., `print('apple', 'pear', 'banana')` prints all three (separated by spaces, or by whatever you pass as the `sep` parameter). Explain why it follows from this feature of `print`, that the additional `sep` and `end` parameters of `print` must _always_ be given as keyword arguments, by considering what happens if you don't:

```python
print('apple', 'pear', 'banana', sep='-', end='.')
print()  # print newline for clarity
print('apple', 'pear', 'banana', '-', '.')
```




**15.18.** ⭐ Why might a programmer choose to force certain parameters of a function to be specified by keyword arguments? Enter `import this` in the interpreter (or in a Python script, and run it). The result is an 'easter egg' that captures some of Python's design principles in poetic form. Which of those could benefit from the (enforced) use of keyword arguments? And what could be the underlying motivation for these principles themselves?




**15.19.** (⭐⭐) _[Optional, feel free to skip]_ For the sake of completeness, the way to let functions take any number of positional arguments (like `print`) and/or enforce the use of keywords for explicitness (like `scatterplot`), is through the use of an asterisked parameter `*` in the function definition header, which essentially 'eats up' any positional arguments given when the function is called; as a consequence (consider why this follows), any parameters occurring after the asterisked parameter cannot be positional, hence _must_ be specified with keywords. Try the following to better understand this:

```python
def some_weird_function(*a, b, c):
    print('a:', a)
    print('b:', b)
    print('c:', c)

# some_weird_function(1, 2, 3)     # will complain that `b` and `c` are not given values, as all positional arguments are eaten up by `*a`.
some_weird_function(1, b=2, c=3)    # this one works fine
some_weird_function(1, 2, 3, 4, b=5, c=6)   # this also works fine
```


**15.20.** _[Optional, feel free to skip]_ Do you understand the role of the asterisk in the following 'official' definition of the built-in `print` function? Does it match how you have used `print` thus far?

```python
def print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False):
    ...
```



<br>**_Parameters with default values_**


**15.21.** We have learned that the syntax `parameter=value` is used in function calls to pass values to the function as keyword arguments. Does it follow that the same syntax in the above definition of `print` shows that `end`, `file` and `flush` are keyword arguments? (Think carefully.)

- - - - - -
**Something to keep in mind:** When you _define_ a function, you can specify **default values** for some or all of the parameters, using `parameter=value` syntax in the header of the function definition (not to be confused with the same `parameter=value` syntax used when _calling_ a function, to specify keyword arguments!). Parameters with default values can be omitted from the function call, in which case the default value is used.
- - - - -

**15.22.** ⭐ Explain how the foregoing is illustrated by the following code:

```python
def multiply_and_add(a, b, c=1):
    print(a * b + c)

multiply_and_add(2, 3)
multiply_and_add(2, 3, 4)
```


**15.23.** Explain how by specifying or omitting default values in your function _definition_, you can effectively make certain arguments **mandatory** and others **optional** when calling the function.


**15.24.** Define a function that prints a simple greeting, by default in English, but other languages can be requested too. Try to implement your function _without_ `if`/`elif`/`else`, by using a dictionary to store the greetings in the various languages (what are advantages of using a dictionary instead of `if`?). How many languages does your function support? What happens if a language is requested that your function does not (yet) support? Is this behavior desirable?




**15.25.** ⭐ Define a function `subtract` with three parameters: two mandatory numbers `a` and `b`, and one optional boolean `absolute`, where the latter has default value `False`. The call `subtract(3, 5)` should evaluate simply to the difference `3 - 5`, i.e., `-2`. The call `subtract(3, 5, True)` should evaluate instead to the absolute (positive) value of the difference, i.e., `2`.

**15.26.** ⭐⭐⭐ Define a tokenizer that takes a text as well as two additional boolean arguments, `keep_punct` and `keep_spaces`, each with default value `False`. On its default behavior, a sentence _"Hi", she said._ would be tokenized as `['Hi', 'she', 'said']`, basically removing punctuation and spaces. But if `keep_punct` is set to `True`, it should treat all punctuation as tokens too; and likewise for `keep_spaces`. For instance, when both are set to `True`, the sentence _"Hi", she said._ should be tokenized as `['"', 'Hi', '"', ',', ' ', 'she', ' ', 'said', '.']`. Some pointers:

- Consider reusing tokenization code from Section 11.
- Remember you can do `import string` to access `string.punctuation`; there is also `string.whitespace`.
- For an extra challenge: in case of multiple consecutive spaces (and tabs, newlines, etc.), bundle these together as a _single_ token (if `keep_spaces` is set to `True`, that is).


- - - - - -
**Something to keep in mind:** While the syntax of specifying default values (`parameter=value`) looks similar to the syntax of keyword arguments explained at the start of this section, the two notions -- default value and keyword argument -- are conceptually _very_ different. Default values are an aspect of function _definitions_, while keyword arguments are an aspect of function _calls_. Whether a parameter is given a default value when _defining_ the function, has nothing directly to do with whether you should use positional or keyword arguments when _calling_ the function.
- - - - -

**15.27.** To illustrate the foregoing explanation, verify that the optional arguments of the `subtract` function and the tokenizer function from previous exercises can be passed both as a positional argument and as a keyword argument. Which way of calling these functions do you find more readable? Which might be less error-prone?

**15.28.** ⭐ Try to predict the printed output of the following function calls (the function was defined above), and test your understanding:
- `multiply_and_add(2, 3, 5)` 
- `multiply_and_add(a=2, b=3, c=5)` 
- `multiply_and_add(c=5, a=2, b=3)` 
- `multiply_and_add(2, b=3)` 
- `multiply_and_add(2, b=3, c=5)` 
- `multiply_and_add(a=2, b=3)` 
- `multiply_and_add(b=3, a=2)`

**15.29.** In function definitions, parameters without default values should come before parameters that have defaults. Try this with an example that violates the rule, e.g., `def my_function(a, b=1, c): ...`.

**15.30.** Given the preceding rule that parameters with defaults should come before parameters without defaults in the function definition, how come the function call `multiply_and_add(c=5, a=2, b=3)` is allowed, i.e., how come `c`, which has a default value, can nevertheless come before `a` and `b` here?

**15.31.** Consider again the function `tokenize` you defined for an earlier exercise in this section. Apply what you have learned in this section by trying to list all the different ways (in terms of positional and/or keyword arguments, in different orders) in which this function can be called.

**15.32.** ⭐ Default values are created only once, at the start, when the function is defined; _not_ each time the function is called. This can lead to puzzling behavior when you use a _mutable_ object like a list as default argument: since it is mutable, it can be changed, thereby causing the default value to change. For example, consider the function below and what it is _supposed_ to do, according to the docstring, if no list argument is given. Explain what goes wrong, taking into account the mutability of the default argument.

```python
def append_to(element, l=[]):       # note: the docstring is a lie
    """
    Appends the element to the provided list, returning it, or to an empty list if none was provided (resulting in [element]).
    """
    l.append(element)
    return l

print(append_to('cat', ['dog', 'horse']))
print(append_to('cat'))
print(append_to('cat', ['mouse']))
print(append_to('cat'))
```
 <!-- amy -->

**15.33.** When entering the above code in PyCharm, the editor will likely immediately warn you that 'Default argument value is mutable'. PyCharm may even offer you to automatically fix it, which will result in code like the following. Try to understand how this fix works, i.e., how it avoids the problem illustrated in the previous exercise:

```python
def append_to2(element, l=None):
    """
    Appends the element to the provided list, returning it, or to an empty list if none was provided (resulting in [element]).
    """
    if l is None:
        l = []
    l.append(element)
    return l

print(append_to2('cat', ['dog', 'horse']))
print(append_to2('cat'))
print(append_to2('cat', ['mouse']))
print(append_to2('cat'))
```

**Something to keep in mind:** The fact that a function's default values are created only once, when the function is defined, reflects that (in Python) functions are not pieces of code but objects ('first-class citizens'), created only once, when the interpreter reads the definition to create the function object (including its default values). Calling a function does not execute the `def`-clause anew, but rather call a designated method on the function object that has already been constructed (and its default values already set).
- - - - -

**15.34.** We have already seen that functions, as objects in their own right, have various properties that you can inspect, such as `__doc__` and `__name__`. Another property of functions is `__defaults__` (not for built-in functions though). Use this to inspect the default values of some of the functions defined above, e.g., `print(append_to.__defaults__)` and `print(multiply_and_add.__defaults__)`. For the problematic function `append_to` from above, compare its `__defaults__` before and after a call `append_to('cat')`.

**15.35.** Explain how the following example illustrates some of what was said above, about default arguments. (`datetime` is a standard libary for working with dates and times.) Is the docstring accurate? (If you want to verify your answer with code, perhaps `import time` is useful too, which provides the function `time.sleep` that can make your program wait a while before executing the next line of code.)

```python
import datetime

def print_the_time(time=datetime.datetime.now()):
    """
    Prints arbitrary times. If no time argument is provided, it prints the current time!
    """
    print(time)
```

**15.36.** ⭐⭐ Define a function `distance` that takes two lists of _n_ numbers (each representing a point in _n_-dimensional space) and computes and returns the distance from one to the other. (Distance in some high-dimensional space is a crucial notion in many fields, including linguistics, e.g., _distributional semantics_.) Crucially, providing the second list is optional: if only one list is provided, the function returns its distance from the origin (the point with _n_ zeroes). In addition, give the function an additional string parameter `metric` with the string `'euclidean'` as default value, but which can also be set to the value `'manhattan'`. The function should compute the corresponding type of distance (search the web for _Euclidean distance_ and _Manhattan distance_ if needed). There are many small mistakes you can make in this exercise, so make sure to properly test your function with a variety of examples for which you know the desired outcome!

**15.37.** Given its parameters and defaults, what are the different ways (i.e., combinations of positional and keyword arguments) in which you can call the `distance` function you defined? For instance, can you predict what the result of `distance([1, 4, 2, 3, 6], 'manhattan')` will be? 



**15.38.** ⭐ This section introduced some tricky and important concepts, so it is important that you try to formulate your own summary. What is the difference between arguments and parameters? What is their relation, i.e., what happens when you call a function with arguments? Can you summarize what keyword arguments and positional arguments are? What are the rules for mixing positional and keyword arguments in your function call? How do default values for function parameters work? Is there a rule that constrains which parameters can and cannot have default values? Why is it risky to specify mutable objects as defaults?
